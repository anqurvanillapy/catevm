# CateVM

An experimental yet opinionated VM for dynamically calling C functions.

## Disclaimer

* Opinionated: Only tested on Linux, x86-64, `__GNUC__ >= 4`
* **NOT** battle-tested
* Inspired by `dyncall`, but with totally different internals

## Trivia

*CateVM* can be expanded into *C 8-byte-sized VM*, namely a C virtual machine
for 64-bit world.
